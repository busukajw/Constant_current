# Constant Load Dummy Load Generator
Project to explore and learn building a Constant Current Dummy Load Generator.
This is going to my first exploration into building an entire electronics
 project. From basic idea and coming up with schematics all the way through a
fully assembled peice of bench test equipment.

## Description:
The main goal of the project is to build a device which will allow a constant
current to be drawn from a "unit under test" and to record the data at regular
intervals.  I intend to use a microprocessor to make this a little  more
interesting with a simple LCD to display the current and volatage and a little
rotoray encoder to set the current to be drawn.
